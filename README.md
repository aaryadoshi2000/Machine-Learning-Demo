# Machine-Learning-Demos


In this project, I gained experience in working with machine learning models for data prediction using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. I worked with supervised models such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbours Classification, and Support Vector Machines Classiciation. In the unsupervised realm, I applied the K Means clustering algorithm and learned how to evaluate accuracy of unsupervised models. 

Furthermore, I managed to train two different neural networks. The first neural network, found in NeuralNetwork.py, consisted of a model that would predict the type of clothing presented in a 28X28 pixel image. The second model, was trained on a large number of text movie reviews which were labelled as either positive or negative. The model was then applied on new reviews to predict whether they consisted of positive or negative reviews to 86% accuracy.
